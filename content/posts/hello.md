Someone who has checked out this site before might have noticed it, for the longest time, had a dreadful "403 Forbidden" error. Oops.

The reason for this is pretty simple: I never bothered to set up a site and configure Nginx with it. It tried to access static content, failed because there was no `index.html`, tried a directory listing, also failed there because it is not configured to allow this and well, there we are. Until today.

# Welcome!
Welcome to the new site! Powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with the awesome [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme, I believe this is a good resemblance of what I always felt a personal site should look and feel like; minimalist, slick and focused on content.

Moreover, because Hugo does not require a full-fledged stack to be running, but merely a server which can serve static content. Therefore, it is hosted entirely on [GitHub Pages through this repository](https://github.com/Yoshi2889/Yoshi2889.github.io) and its [roots available through this repository](https://github.com/Yoshi2889/Yoshi2889). Huge shoutout to GitHub for making this possible!

# What's this about, then?
First of all, I'm not a blogger. The content of this blog will be based purely on my own thoughts, ideas and projects. They might be accurate; they might not be. For me it is a place to capture interesting bits and pieces.

I'll try to keep articles short and to the point. Just like the design; less is more. Speaking of which, this was really just meant as a quick 'hello'-style article, and it's beginning to grow beyond that.

I hope this content will be of use to somebody!
